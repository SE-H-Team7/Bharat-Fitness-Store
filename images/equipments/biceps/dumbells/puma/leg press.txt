LEG PRESS
Description:
The leg press is, quite simply, a weight training exercise in which you push a weight or any kind of heavy object away by using your legs. It is usually used to evaluate the person’s strength in the lower body (more specifically, the knees and joints). If not done correctly, it can cause heavy injuries in the knees or ankles, so you should never do it without a trained expert by your side. Check out the various gym machines for home gym. There are many benefits to doing leg presses in opposition to other types of exercises. The leg press works four muscle groups, such as the calves, gluteus maximus, hamstring and the quadriceps. Depending on the angle of the sled and the position of the feet, one muscle group will be worked more than the others.
