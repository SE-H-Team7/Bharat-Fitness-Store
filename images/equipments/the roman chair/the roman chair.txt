THE ROMAN CHAIR
Description:
Most of us have jobs where we are sitting at a desk about 90% of the time. There are several studies that have found out problems with sitting continuously for more than a period of time. Not to mention bad posture that we eventually pick up during very stressful hours. So how do we undo the damage that has beset our body? Back extensions carried out with the help of a roman chair can alleviate most of the problems associated with sitting continuously and bad posture.
Normally, this is a byproduct of the effect of bad posture and sitting down too long. Again, these are problems that a few sessions on the roman chair can fix. Hyperextensions increases lower back mobility and strengthens your abs and back muscles. This results in lesser stress on the spine when you have to sit. This is also and added advantage when you consider powerlifting.
